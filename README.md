A dynamic web dashboard for supply chain management empowers
businesses with real-time analytics tailored to specific regions, countries,
or states. By incorporating flexible time range filters, decision-makers can
swiftly zoom in on critical data, identify trends, and detect inefficiencies
within any segment of their business. This level of accessibility facilitates
on-the-go decision-making, enabling prompt responses to emerging issues
or opportunities. Such a dashboard serves as an essential tool for
optimizing logistics, managing inventory levels, and improving customer
satisfaction, ultimately leading to enhanced operational efficiency and a
stronger bottom line for the business.
Using this dashboard the stakeholders can easily zoom into the very detail
of each city and make decisions based on the analysis received.


## üîç Conclusion

In conclusion, this report synthesizes key insights and actionable strategies derived from
an extensive data analysis. A recurring theme is the challenge of late deliveries, notably
within First Class and Second Class shipping options, suggesting the need for an overhaul
of logistics strategies. The report recommends prioritizing shipping standard class orders
within four days, first class orders within one day and second class orders within two
days to mitigate delays. Analysis of order placement times reveals that orders made after
noon carry a higher risk of late delivery, guiding the logistics team to reallocate resources
and adjust delivery estimates accordingly. Furthermore, certain brands and products
with high late delivery probabilities, such as Bushnell and SOLE Elliptical products,
demand an in-depth review of their supply chain processes. The report highlights
products that command high profit margins and suggests leveraging marketing efforts to
amplify sales, while advising a reevaluation of discount strategies or potential
discontinuation of loss-making products. Overall, the insights aim to streamline
operations, enhance customer trust, and bolster the profitability of the business.
